            <p>Nepali momo is a popular and delicious dumpling dish that is loved throughout Nepal and beyond. To prepare momo, start by making the dough with all-purpose flour and water, kneading it until smooth and elastic. Let the dough rest while you prepare the filling. The filling typically consists of finely minced meat (such as chicken, pork, or buffalo), chopped onions, garlic, ginger, cilantro, and spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. You can also add some finely chopped vegetables or tofu for a vegetarian option. Once the filling is mixed well, roll out small pieces of dough into thin circles.</p>
            <p>Next, place a spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle and fold the edges, pinching them together to seal the dumpling into a half-moon or round shape. Steam the momos in a steamer for about 10-12 minutes until the wrappers become translucent and the filling is fully cooked. Traditionally, momo is served with a dipping sauce called "achar," made from tomatoes, sesame seeds, garlic, and chili, giving it a tangy and spicy flavor. This hearty and flavorful dish is enjoyed as a snack or main course, bringing people together for a tasty and comforting meal.</p>
